# This folder should hold a file for the driving run.

There should be some `filename.xdf` collected with LabRecorder. It should hold streams for the EEG data, 
the predicted steering commands and the Unity driving simulation.

This is not tracked in github, but should be collected from participant data storage the authors have access to.
A similar folder may exist for each participant.
